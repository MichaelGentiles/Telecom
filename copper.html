      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Copper-based systems, such as twisted pair and coaxial cables, have long been prevalent in telephone networks and DSL broadband. These systems operate by carrying electrical signals through metal wires.
      </p>
      <h2>Function</h2>
      <p>
        These systems are mainly utilized for voice and data transmission over short to medium distances. While they offer lower speeds compared to fiber optics, they still play a crucial role in legacy infrastructure.
